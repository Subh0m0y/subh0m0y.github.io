Hey guys, I'm Subhomoy Haldar, a Java [journeyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) who is on the long road to becoming a master.

This is a blog that I've created quickly to share a few of my ideas about programming in general. I love algorithms, especially numeric algorithms. I am currently working on an arbitrary-precision mathematical library for Java.
