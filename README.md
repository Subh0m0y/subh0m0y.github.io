# The Cristatus Saga

## The (mis)adventures of a Java journeyman.

Hi! I am [Subhomoy Haldar](https://github.com/Subh0m0y/), a Java enthusiast, who is not quite a master of the language yet. I can be described as a "journeyman" - an intermediate programmer who isn't a novice, but has still a long way to go.

If you're interested, then read [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) by authors Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. This is where the term "journeyman" comes from in the programmers' context.

The [Merriam-Webster](https://merriam-webster.com/) dictionary defines "journeyman" in the traditional context:

>Full Definition of journeyman
1. :  a worker who has learned a trade and works for another person usually by the day
2. :  an experienced reliable worker, athlete, or performer especially as distinguished from one who is brilliant or colorful <a good journeyman trumpeter â€” New Yorker> <a journeyman outfielder>

But the authors (and I) apply the word in a different context.
