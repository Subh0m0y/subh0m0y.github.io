title: My first blog post!

No, I have done some blogging before, using Blogger. But this is my first time using Jekyll - the static site generator. Jekyll, coupled with GitHub Pages provide a simple solution for making a "no-strings-attached" blog.

I want to thank Barry Clark for providing this simple way of blog creation. You can make your own blog too. Just go to his [tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
